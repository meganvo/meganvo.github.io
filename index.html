			<p>Iâ€™m a product designer with 10 years of experience at early stage startups and large companies. I'm currently taking a career break dedicated to crossing things off my bucket list and seeing where my heart takes me. Previously, I designed experiences to make selling easier on Etsy.</p>
			
			<p>Reach out at <a href="mailto:meganmvo@gmail.com">meganmvo@gmail.com</a> if you'd like to learn more about my product design work. For now, here's <a href="http://azngrl1423.deviantart.com/" target="_blank">my middle school Deviantart</a> and some <a href="https://crosswordr.com/meganvo">crosswords I enjoyed making.</a></p>
